# steamworks-swift

Experiment with Steamworks SDK and Swift C++ importer.

**Caveat Integrator: The Swift C++ importer is a chaotic science project; this package is built on top**

Current state:
* Requires Swift 5.7, Xcode 14 beta -- the C++ importer is a unstable science project
* Code gen creates Swift versions of Steam types; callbacks and call-returns work
* All interfaces complete - see [rough docs](https://johnfairh.github.io/swift-steamworks/index.html)
* Some interface quality-of-life helpers in a separate `SteamworksHelpers` module
* `make test` builds and runs unit tests that run frame loops and access portions of the Steam API
  doing various sync and async tasks.
* Encrypted app ticket support in separate `SteamworksEncryptedAppTicket` module
* Separate demo showing encrypted app-ticket stuff, `make run_ticket`
* The Xcode project basically works, assumes `sdk` exists.  SourceKit can manage
  tab completion even if module interface gen is beyond it

### Concept

* Offer a pure Swift module `Steamworks` covering all of the current Steamworks API
* Leave out the deprecated and WIN32-only stuff
* Do not diverge too far from the 'real' API names to aid docs / searching / porting:
  I think this is a better starting point than doing a complete OO analysis to carve
  out function.  Can go to build `SteamworksPatterns` or something if worthwhile.  Name
  etc. changes:
   * _Don't_ use Swift properties for 0-arg getters: diverges too far from Steamworks
     naming
   * Drop the intermittent Hungarian notation (argh the 1990s are calling)
   * Use Swift closures for callbacks as well as async-await sugar
   * Map unions onto enums with associated values
* Provide custom API-lifetime and message dispatch classes
* Provide strongly typed handles
* Access interfaces via central types
* Use code gen to deal with the ~900 APIs and their ~400 types, taking advantage of the
  handy JSON file.  This code-gen piece is the actual main work in this project
* Provide quality-of-life helpers module `SteamworksHelpers` to wrap up API patterns
  involving multiple calls, usually determining buffer lengths

### API mapping design

### Lifecycle

```swift
// Initialization
let steam = SteamAPI(appID: MyAppId) // or `SteamGameServerAPI`

// Frame loop
steam.runCallbacks() // or `steam.releaseCurrentThreadMemory()`

// Shutdown
// ...when `steam` goes out of scope
```

### Callbacks

C++
```cpp
STEAM_CALLBACK(MyClass, OnUserStatsReceived, UserStatsReceived_t, m_CallbackUserStatsReceived);

...

m_CallbackUserStatsReceived( this, &MyClass::OnUserStatsReceived )

...

void MyClass::OnUserStatsReceived( UserStatsReceived_t *pCallback ) {
  ...
}
```
Swift
```swift
steam.onUserStatsReceived { userStatsReceived in
  ...
}
```

There are async versions too, like:
```
for await userStatsReceived in steam.userStatsReceived {
  ...
}
```
...but these need the panacea of custom executors to be practical.

#### Functions

```cpp
auto handle = SteamInventory()->StartUpdateProperties();
```
```swift
let handle = steam.inventory.startUpdateProperties()
```

### Call-return style

C++
```cpp
CCallResult<MyClass, FriendsGetFollowerCount_t> m_GetFollowerCountCallResult;

...

auto hSteamAPICall = SteamFriends.GetFollowerCount(steamID);
m_GetFollowerCountCallResult.Set(hSteamAPICall, this, &MyClass::OnGetFollowerCount);

...

void MyClass::OnGetFollowerCount(FriendsGetFollowerCount_t *pCallback, bool bIOFailure) {
  ...
}

```
Swift
```swift
steam.friends.getFollowerCount(steamID: steamID) { getFollowerCount in
  guard let getFollowerCount = getFollowerCount else {
    // `bIOFailure` case
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Again there are async versions that are impractical for now:
```swift
let getFollowerCount = await steam.friends.getFollowerCount(steamID: steamID)
```

### Array-length parameters

Parameters carrying the length of an input array are discarded because Swift arrays
carry their length with them.

### 'Out' parameters

C++ 'out' parameters filled in by APIs are returned in a tuple, or, if the Steam API
is `void` then as the sole return value.

```cpp
SteamInventoryResult_t result;
bool rc = SteamInventory()->GrantPromoItems(&result);
```
```swift
let (rc, result) = steamAPI.inventory.grantPromoItems()
```

### Optional 'out' parameters

Some C++ 'out' parameters are optional: they can be passed as `NULL` to indicate they're
not required by caller.  In the Swift API these generate an additional boolean parameter
`return<ParamName>` with default `true`.

```cpp
auto avail = SteamNetworkingUtils()->GetRelayNetworkStatusAvailability(NULL);
```
```swift
let (avail, _) = steamAPI.networkingUtils.getRelayNetworkStatusAvailability(returnDetails: false)
```

The return tuple is still populated with something but its contents is undefined; the
library guarantees to pass `NULL` to the underlying Steamworks API.

### 'In-out' parameters

C++ parameters whose values are significant and also have their value updated are present
in _both_ Swift function parameters and the return tuple.

```cpp
uint32 itemDefIDCount = 0;
bool rc1 = SteamInventory()->GetItemDefinitionIDs(NULL, &itemDefIDCount);
auto itemDefIDs = new SteamItemDef_t [itemDefIDCount];
bool rc2 = SteamInventory()->GetItemDefinitions(itemDefIDs, &itemDefIDCount);
```
```swift
let (rc1, _, itemDefIDCount) = steamAPI.inventory.
                                   getItemDefinitionIDs(returnItemDefIDs: false,
                                                        itemDefIDsArraySize: 0)
let (rc2, itemDefIDs, _) = steamAPI.inventory.
                               getItemDefinitionIDs(itemDefIDsArraySize: itemDefIDCount)
```

### Default parameter values

Default values are provided where the API docs suggest a value, but there are still APIs
where caller is required to provide a max buffer length for an output string -- these look
pretty weird in Swift but no way to avoid.  Some Steamworks APIs support the old "pass NULL
to get the required length" two-pass style and these patterns are wrapped up in a Swifty
way in the `SteamworksHelpers` module.

### Swift C++ Bugs

Tech limitations, on 5.7 Xcode 14.0b3:
* ~~Have to manually tell Swift to link with `libc++`.  Verify by commenting from
  Makefile.  When resolved tidy Makefile. ~~ currently fixed in 5.7
* ~~Importing `Dispatch` and `-enable-cxx-interop` makes `DispatchSemaphore` disappear
  but not the rest of the module?? Work around.  When resolved rewrite mutex.~~ currently
  fixed in 5.7
* Some structures/classes aren't imported -- the common factor seems to be a `protected`
  destructor.  Verify by trying to use `SteamNetworkingMessage_t`.
* Something goes wrong storing pointers to classes and they get nobbled by something.
  Verify by making `SteamIPAddress` a struct, changing interfaces to cache the interface
  pointers.
* Some C++ types with `operator ==` don't have `Equatable` generated.  Verify with
  `SteamNetworkingIPAddr`.  Got worse in 5.7
* ~~ Importing `Foundation` and `-enable-cxx-interop` and a C++ module goes wrong.  Swift
  5.6 doesn't crash; worse the compiler goes slow, spits out warnings, then the binary
  runs like treacle.  Will aim to not depend on Foundation, see how that goes. ~~ seems
  fixed in 5.7 but build is really slow - keep up not using Foundation?
* Calls to virtual functions aren't generated properly: Swift generates a ref
  to a symbol instead of doing the vtable call.  So the actual C++ interfaces are not
  usable in practice.  Will use the flat API.
* Anonymous enums are not imported at all.  Affects callback etc. ID constants.
  Will work around.
* sourcekit won't give me a module interface for `CSteamworks` to see what else the
  importer is doing.  Probably Xcode's fault, still not passing the user's flags to
  sourcekit and still doing insultingly bad error-reporting.

### Non-Swift Problems

* Some [Steamworks SDK issues](#json-notes), nothing too serious.
* How do I CI this stuff?  SDK license doesn't seem to allow non-local redistribution,
  with that could build the thing; don't really fancy installing the steam client but
  maybe that's doable.

#### Weird Steam messages

Getting unexpected SteamAPICallCompleteds out of
`SteamAPI_ManualDispatch_GetNextCallback()` -- suspect parts of steamworks trying to
use callbacks internally without understanding manual dispatch mode.  Or I'm missing
an API somewhere to dispatch them.

* 2101 - `HTTPRequestCompleted_t.k_iCallback`
* 1296 - `k_iSteamNetworkingUtilsCallbacks + 16` - undefined, not a clue

Seems triggered by using steamnetworking.

Facepunch logs & drops these too, so, erm, shrug I suppose.

Getting `src/steamnetworkingsockets/clientlib/csteamnetworkingmessages.cpp (229) : Assertion Failed: [#40725897 pipe] Unlinking connection in state 1` using steamnetworkingmessages; possibly
it's not expecting to send messages from a steam ID to itself.

### Requirements

* Needs Swift 5.7 (Xcode 14 beta)
* Needs Steam client installed
* I'm using macOS 12; should work on macOS 11, Linux; might work on Windows

To run the generator / build:
* Needs Steamworks SDK downloaded as `sdk` at the top level of the package, or
  set `STEAM_SDK`

### Interface plan

âœ… ISteamAppList, ISteamApps, ISteamFriends, ISteamGameSearch, ISteamGameServer,
ISteamGameServerStats, ISteamHTMLSruface, ISteamHTTP, ISteamInput, ISteamInventory,
ISteamMatchMaking, ISteamMatchmakingServers, ISteamMusic, ISteamMusicRemote,
ISteamNetworkingMessages, ISteamNetworkingSockets, ISteamNetworkingUtils,
ISteamParentalSettings, ISteamParties, ISteamRemotePlay, ISteamRemoteStorage,
ISteamScreenshots, ISteamUGC, ISteamUser, ISteamUserStats, ISteamUtils, ISteamVideo,
SteamEncryptedAppTicket

Skip:
* ISteamAppTicket - er not actually a thing?
* ISteamClient - internal stuff, very C++y, looks ignorable
* ISteamController - deprecated, need to review for stuff that's been generated and
  can actually be deleted after working through ISteamInput
* ISteamGameCoordinator - "largely" deprecated
* ISteamNetworking - this is the pre-modern interface
* ISteamPS3... - will leave Swift-on-PS3 for another day

### JSON notes

Capture some notes on troubles reflecting the json into the module.

* The 'modern' `isteamnetworking` stuff is incomplete somehow - Json describes
  `SteamDatagramGameCoordinatorServerLogin`, `SteamDatagramHostedAddress` are missing
  from the header files.  The online API docs are hilariously broken here, scads of
  broken links.  Have to wait for Valve to fix this.

  I found some of this in the SDR SDK, but it's not supported on macOS and uses actual
  grown-up C++ with `std::string` and friends so best leave it alone for now.

* `SteamNetworkingMessage_t` doesn't import into Swift.  Probably stumbling into a hole
  of C++ struct with function pointer fields.  Trust Apple will get to this eventually,
  will write a zero-cost inline shim.

* Json (and all non-C languages) struggles with unions.  Thankfully rare:
  `SteamIPAddress_t`, `SteamInputAction_t`, `SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t`.
  `SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t`.  Rare enough to deal with manually.

* Loads of missing `out_string_count` etc. annotations and a few wrong, see patchfile.
