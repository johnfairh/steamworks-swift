# steamworks-swift

Experiment with Steamworks SDK and Swift C++ importer.

Current state:
* Requires Swift 5.7, Xcode 14 beta
* Code gen creates Swift versions of Steam types; callbacks and call-returns work
* First pass all interfaces complete - see [rough docs](https://johnfairh.github.io/swift-steamworks/index.html)
* Interface quality-of-life tweaks needed, esp. returned string/array length
* `make` builds and runs a demo Swift program that accesses the C++
  Steam API to initialize, do various sync and async queries, then shut it down.
* Separate demo showing encrypted app-ticket stuff.
* The Xcode project basically works, assumes `sdk` exists.  SourceKit can manage
  tab completion even if module interface gen is beyond it.

### Concept

* Offer a pure Swift module covering all of the current Steamworks API.
* Leave out the deprecated and WIN32-only stuff.
* Do not diverge too far from the 'real' API names to aid docs / searching / porting:
  I think this is a better starting point than doing a complete OO analysis to carve
  out function.  Can go to build `SteamworksPatterns` or something if worthwhile.  Name
  etc. changes:
   * _Don't_ use Swift properties for 0-arg getters: diverges too far from Steamworks
     naming
   * Drop the intermittent Hungarian notation (argh the 1990s are calling)
   * Use Swift closures for callbacks as well as async-await sugar
   * Map unions onto enums with associated values
* Provide custom API-lifetime and message dispatch classes.
* Provide strongly typed handles.
* Access interfaces via central types.
* Use code gen to deal with the ~900 APIs and their ~400 types, taking advantage of the
  handy JSON file.  This code-gen piece is the actual main work in this project.

### API mapping design

#### Functions

```cpp
auto handle = SteamInventory()->StartUpdateProperties();
```
```swift
let handle = steamAPI.inventory.startUpdateProperties()
```

### 'Out' parameters

C++ 'out' parameters filled in by APIs are returned in a tuple, or, if the Steam API
is `void` then as the sole return value.

```cpp
SteamInventoryResult_t result;
bool rc = SteamInventory()->GrantPromoItems(&result);
```
```swift
let (rc, result) = steamAPI.inventory.grantPromotItems()
```

### Optional 'out' parameters

Some C++ 'out' parameters are optional: they can be passed as `NULL` to indicate they're
not required by caller.  In the Swift API these generate an additional boolean parameter
`return<ParamName>` with default `true`.

```cpp
auto avail = SteamNetworkingUtils()->GetRelayNetworkStatusAvailability(NULL);
```
```swift
let (avail, _) = steamAPI.networkingUtils.getRelayNetworkStatusAvailability(returnDetails: false)
```

The return tuple is still populated with something but its contents is undefined; the
library guarantees to pass `NULL` to the underlying Steamworks API.

### 'In-out' parameters

C++ parameters whose values are significant and also have their value updated are present
in _both_ Swift function parameters and the return tuple.

```cpp
uint32 itemDefIDCount = 0;
bool rc1 = SteamInventory()->GetItemDefinitionIDs(NULL, &itemDefIDCount);
auto itemDefIDs = new SteamItemDef_t [itemDefIDCount];
bool rc2 = SteamInventory()->GetItemDefinitions(itemDefIDs, &itemDefIDCount);
```
```swift
let (rc1, _, itemDefIDCount) = steamAPI.inventory.
                                   getItemDefinitionIDs(returnItemDefIDs: false,
                                                        itemDefIDsArraySize: 0)
let (rc2, itemDefIDs, _) = steamAPI.inventory.
                               getItemDefinitionIDs(itemDefIDsArraySize: itemDefIDCount)
```
This pattern is a best-effort translation of the Steamworks API that inherently requires two
calls - still pretty ugly and would expect to be wrapped up in a utility.


### Swift C++ Bugs

Tech limitations, on 5.6:
* Have to manually tell Swift to link with `libc++`.  Verify by commenting from
  Makefile.  When resolved tidy Makefile.
* Importing `Dispatch` and `-enable-cxx-interop` makes `DispatchSemaphore` disappear
  but not the rest of the module?? Work around.  When resolved rewrite mutex.
* Some structures/classes aren't imported -- the common factor seems to be a `protected`
  destructor.  Verify by trying to use `SteamNetworkingMessage_t`.
* Something goes wrong storing pointers to base classes and they get nobbled by
  something.  Verify by making `SteamIPAddress` a struct, changing interfaces to cache
  the interface pointers.
* C++ types with `operator ==` don't have `Equatable` generated.  Verify with
  `SteamNetworkingIPAddr`.
* Importing `Foundation` and `-enable-cxx-interop` and a C++ module goes wrong.  Swift
  5.6 doesn't crash; worse the compiler goes slow, spits out warnings, then the binary
  runs like treacle.  Will aim to not depend on Foundation, see how that goes.
* Calls to (?pure) virtual functions aren't generated properly: Swift generates a ref
  to a symbol instead of doing the vtable call.  So the actual C++ interfaces are not
  usable in practice.  Will use the flat API.
* Anonymous enums are not imported at all.  Affects callback etc. ID constants.
  Will work around.
* sourcekit won't give me a module interface for `CSteamworks` to see what else the
  importer is doing.  Probably Xcode's fault, still not passing the user's flags to
  sourcekit and still doing insultingly bad error-reporting.

### Non-Swift Problems

* Some [Steamworks SDK issues](#json-notes), nothing too serious.
* How do I CI this stuff?  SDK license doesn't seem to allow non-local redistribution,
  with that could build the thing; don't really fancy installing the steam client but
  maybe that's doable.

#### Weird Steam messages

Getting unexpected SteamAPICallCompleteds out of
`SteamAPI_ManualDispatch_GetNextCallback()` -- suspect parts of steamworks trying to
use callbacks internally without understanding manual dispatch mode.  Or I'm missing
an API somewhere to dispatch them.

* 2101 - `HTTPRequestCompleted_t.k_iCallback`
* 1296 - `k_iSteamNetworkingUtilsCallbacks + 16` - undefined, not a clue

Seems triggered by using steamnetworking.

Facepunch logs & drops these too, so, erm, shrug I suppose.

Getting `src/steamnetworkingsockets/clientlib/csteamnetworkingmessages.cpp (229) : Assertion Failed: [#40725897 pipe] Unlinking connection in state 1` using steamnetworkingmessages; possibly
it's not expecting to send messages from a steam ID to itself.

### Requirements

* Needs Swift 5.7 (Xcode 14 beta)
* Needs Steam client installed
* I'm using macOS 12; should work on macOS 11, Linux; might work on Windows

To run the generator / build:
* Needs Steamworks SDK downloaded as `sdk` at the top level of the package, or
  set `STEAM_SDK`

### Interface plan

âœ… ISteamAppList, ISteamApps, ISteamFriends, ISteamGameSearch, ISteamGameServer,
ISteamGameServerStats, ISteamHTMLSruface, ISteamHTTP, ISteamInput, ISteamInventory,
ISteamMatchMaking, ISteamMatchmakingServers, ISteamMusic, ISteamMusicRemote,
ISteamNetworkingMessages, ISteamNetworkingSockets, ISteamNetworkingUtils,
ISteamParentalSettings, ISteamParties, ISteamRemotePlay, ISteamRemoteStorage,
ISteamScreenshots, ISteamUGC, ISteamUser, ISteamUserStats, ISteamUtils, ISteamVideo,
SteamEncryptedAppTicket

Left to do:
* Pondering of int types etc.
* Array and String management improvements

Skip:
* ISteamAppTicket - er not actually a thing?
* ISteamClient - internal stuff, very C++y, looks ignorable
* ISteamController - deprecated, need to review for stuff that's been generated and
  can actually be deleted after working through ISteamInput
* ISteamGameCoordinator - "largely" deprecated
* ISteamNetworking - this is the pre-modern interface
* ISteamPS3... - will leave Swift-on-PS3 for another day

### JSON notes

Capture some notes on troubles reflecting the json into the module.

* The 'modern' `isteamnetworking` stuff is incomplete somehow - Json describes
  `SteamDatagramGameCoordinatorServerLogin`, `SteamDatagramHostedAddress` are missing
  from the header files.  The online API docs are hilariously broken here, scads of
  broken links.  Have to wait for Valve to fix this.

* `SteamNetworkingMessage_t` doesn't import into Swift.  Probably stumbling into a hole
  of C++ struct with function pointer fields.  Trust Apple will get to this eventually,
  can write a zero-cost inline shim if necessary.

* Json (and all non-C languages) struggles with unions.  Thankfully rare:
  `SteamIPAddress_t`, `SteamInputAction_t`, `SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t`.
  `SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t`.  Rare enough to deal with manually.

* Loads of missing `out_string_count` etc. annotations and a few wrong, see patchfile.
