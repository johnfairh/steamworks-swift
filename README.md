# swift-steamworks

Experiment with Steamworks SDK and Swift C++ importer.

* Needs Swift 5.5
* Needs Steam client installed
* Needs Steamworks SDK downloaded as `sdk` at the top level of the package, or
  update `Makefile`
* Needs macOS; should work on Linux; might work on Windows

State:
* `make` builds and runs a Swift program that directly accesses the C++
   Steam API to initialize & then shut it down.  Might have to run it twice to
   get the build working ðŸ™ƒ

Stalled by:
* importing `Foundation` with `-enable-cxx-interop` crashes the compiler.
  Need to try a trunk build.
* sourcekit won't give me a module interface for `CSteamWorks` to see how
  the importer is doing.  Need to build the compiler and debug.
* research into .net etc. wrappers for what a native Swift layer should do.
